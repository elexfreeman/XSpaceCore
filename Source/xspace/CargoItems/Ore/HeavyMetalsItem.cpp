	this->description = "In chemistry, 'heavy metals' is a term used to describe a group of metallic elements \
		that have relatively high atomic numbers and densities compared to other elements. \
There is no strict definition for which elements qualify as heavy metals, but they typically \
include elements with atomic numbers greater than 20, which includes elements like lead (Pb),\
 mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and others. \
\
		Here are some common characteristics and properties of heavy metals :\
\
	1. **Density : ** Heavy metals are generally dense, meaning they have a high mass per unit volume.\
\
		2. **Toxicity : ** Many heavy metals are toxic to living organisms, including humans, even at low \
		concentrations.For example, lead poisoning from lead exposure is a well - known health concern.\
\
		3. **Chemical Behavior : ** Heavy metals often have complex chemistry and can form various compounds, some of which can be harmful.\
\
		4. **Accumulation : ** Heavy metals can accumulate in the environment, particularly in \
aquatic ecosystems, leading to long - term pollution.\
\
		5. **Bioaccumulation : ** They can also bioaccumulate in living organisms, where they can \
		be passed up the food chain, potentially leading to higher concentrations in top - level predators.\
\
		6. **Environmental Impact : ** Heavy metals can have adverse effects on the environment, including\
 soil and water pollution, which can harm ecosystems and human health.\
\
		It's important to note that not all heavy metals are harmful. Some heavy metals,\
 like zinc and copper, are essential trace elements that the human body needs in small amounts\
 for various physiological functions. However, an excess of these essential heavy metals can also be harmful.\
\
		Due to their toxicity and potential environmental and health impacts, the presence and \
concentration of heavy metals in various products, industries, and the environment are closely\
 monitored and regulated in many countries.Proper disposal and management of products and waste\
 containing heavy metals are essential to minimize their negative effects.";
